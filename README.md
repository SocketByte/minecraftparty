# MinecraftParty
Okay so there's an interesting story behind this project.
The most important thing is - it's now public.

It's not finished, it requires few changes, design replanning etc.
It's a good starting point to make own, personalized arenas for mc party gamemode. The code is absolutely free.

Have fun or something.
